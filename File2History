  <h1 title="Apothercary History">Apothecary History</h1>
  <p>Apothecary (/əˈpɒθɪkəri/) is one term for a medical professional who formulates and dispenses materia medica to physicians, surgeons,</br> 
  <p/>and patients. The modern pharmacist (also colloquially referred to as a chemist in British English) has taken over this role.</br> 
  <p/>In some languages and regions, the word "apothecary" is still used to refer to a retail pharmacy or a pharmacist who owns one.</br> 
  <p/>Apothecaries' investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients was a precursor to the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology.</br>
<p/> </br>
<p/>In addition to dispensing herbs and medicine, the apothecary offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed</br> 
<p/>by other specialist practitioners, such as surgeons and obstetricians. Apothecary shops sold ingredients and the medicines they prepared</br> 
<p/>wholesale to other medical practitioners, as well as dispensing them to patients. In seventeenth century England, they also controlled</br>
<p/>the trade of tobacco which was imported as a medicine.
